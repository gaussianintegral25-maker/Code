# Code
The source code (Inspired by IoannisNasios) is in the Source Code file. Here, I used Ioannis's solarsystem model to create a program using hyperbolic paths, to track the optimal path of spacecraft to planets such as Mars from Earth. I did this by locating their L2 points. I also made a function to charge the individuals for the trip to said planets from LEO.
