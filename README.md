# Newton's NASA Space Apps Challenge Submission (16yo)
The source code (Inspired by IoannisNasios) is in the Source Code file. Here, I used Ioannis's solarsystem model to create a program using hyperbolic paths, to track the optimal path of spacecraft to planets such as Mars from Earth. I did this by locating their L2 points. I also made a function to charge the individuals for the trip to said planets from LEO. 
I used the equation of the Departure Transit Orbit from this paper: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228780297_Interplanetary_and_lunar_transfers_using_libration_points
The source code is in the file named 'Source Code' and in the codespace named 'Source_Code'
